## References and further reading

The core text we will refer to is [AI
Engines](https://jim-stone.staff.shef.ac.uk/AIEngines/), of which you
will receive a copy.

Most core papers that we mention should be available through our
[Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/shared/pb4w0p) collection.  Click on
the "View PDF" link below each reference to get direct access to the
paper.  These PDFs are provided only for educational use.

A book full of practical implementations in Python (and R) is by
[Chollet](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).
Finally, slightly old now but still regarded as the "bible" and freely
available online is [Goodfellow et al](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
